Contains files that are modified versions of those provided with civi.

copy_extension.php copies the files to their final location.

Case.php
========
  Created by the script Case_patch.php

  Different form original in that civicrm_case_type and civicrm_case table names have been replaced by brisskit-specific views. 

DAO.php
=======
  Manually created

  Amended so that when a DAO object is initialised, a mysql variable is set so the the brisskit-specific views pullback case types and cases filtered by component name.
  Pull in BK_Utils.php and BK_Hooks.php to acheive this

I18n.php
========
  Manually created

  Amended to call the brisskit_ts() function which does word replacements appropriate to CiviStudy and CiviRecruitment.

civi_settings.php 
=================
  Manually created
  
  Defines 2 constants used by our patched version of DAO.php, BK_EXTENSIONS_DIR and BK_HOOKS_DIR.
